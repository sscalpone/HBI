1. Growth charts.  This is the visual indication of where the child fits on the height/weight chart.  The will require finding the data that describes the expected curves, encoding that data into our database, and creating a chart based on that data plus the child's actual height/weight.  The chart must graph the child's changes over time, too.

2. Orthodontic charts.  An interactive click-sensitive picture of teeth. The clicks must be recorded & visible, and then saved to the database.  Data from the database must be able to be re-displayed as the picture. Example pictures here:  http://ortho-experience.com/teeth-names--numbers.html

3. Form validation. 
	From a form page, make sure all fields are filled out before saving.
    - Ask the user if they want to cancel, and don't leave.
    - Ask the user if they want to leave anyway, and save the work-in-progress
    - Ask the user if they want to leave anyway and forget their work.

4. Photo upload and photo management.  The children will be photographed & the photographs saved.  Need a page to upload new photos, and view, download, or delete existing photos.

5. Data export.  Need to be able to export data so it can be re-imported into another instance of the app or into excel.  I propose that we add GUIDs for each child and each record so it is easy to de-dup imports.

6. Data import.  Need to be able to import existing excel data (mapping from columns to the app's db).

7. Data import.  Need to be able to import data that was exported from the app, de-duping as needed.

8. Accounts & security.  The desire is to have three-levels of security -- super user, medial staff, others -- each with a unique login and rights to view data.

9. Code review and security review.
