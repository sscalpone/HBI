1. Orthodontic charts. An interactive click-sensitive picture of teeth. The clicks must be recorded & visible, and then saved to the database.  Data from the database must be able to be re-displayed as the picture. Example pictures here:  http://ortho-experience.com/teeth-names--numbers.html

2. Photo upload and management. Photo page currently exists but need a way to delete photo from media/photos when photo is deleted from database.

3. Data export.  Need to be able to export data so it can be re-imported into another instance of the app or into excel. I propose that we add GUIDs for each child and each record so it is easy to de-dup imports.

4. Data import. Need to be able to import existing excel data (mapping from columns to the app's db).

5. Data import. Need to be able to import data that was exported from the app, de-duping as needed.

6. Accounts & security. The desire is to have three-levels of security -- super user, medial staff, others -- each with a unique login and rights to view data.

7. Code review and security review.
