You'll be happier if you install virtual env.

We are using Django 1.6.1 and Python 2.7.5.

Install the Python Image Tools:
pip install Pillow

First you'll want a fresh database:
rm -f database/mysite.db
python manage.py syncdb

It's going to prompt you for a superuser.
admin/123456

Start the server with this:
python manage.py runserver

Here's how you get to the admin console:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Connect to the server with your browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/tracker/

Initialize the db with some data:
cp media/photos/me.png fixtures/
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/basic.json
